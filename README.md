# Egui Tesla App

Tesla app implementation using Rust and [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui).  
This project is an experiment to replicate the animations and interactions of the Tesla app originally built with Flutter (see references below).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The code is still in an early stage and contains several bugs. The main purpose of this project is to explore and learn about Rust + egui across different platforms, **especially as an exploration of using egui for animation needs**.

‚úÖ Currently, the app runs fine on **Linux (Ubuntu)** and **Android**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è On **WASM**, animations are not working properly due to limitations in using `std::time` with WebAssembly.

# Demo

![Preview](/tesla-app.gif)

# Android

Built using [`xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-mobile/xbuild)

## Building

    x build --arch arm64 --platform android --release

## Running

    x run --device <DEVICE>

### Example

    $ x devices
    host                                              Linux               linux x64           Arch Linux 6.6.2-arch1-1
    adb:d535946                                       OnePlus5T           android arm64       Android 10 (API 29)
    $ x run --device adb:d535946


# WASM

## Building

    cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown

## Running

    trunk serve --port 9999 --release

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Animations are currently broken on WASM because `std::time` is not fully supported in WebAssembly. Further investigation is needed (e.g., using wasm-bindgen or gloo_timers).

# Native

## Building

    cargo build

## Running

    cargo run --release
